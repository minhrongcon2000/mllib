# mllib
## What is mllib
mllib is my personal project of building a Machine Learning Library for myself so that I could understand every Machine Learning models thoroughly and gain some experiences in some field of ML. 
## What is my purpose?
I think you may ask why I publish my work here. I believe that GitHub is the best social media for me to post my work and recieve some objective opinions, so that I can improve my skill. 

I know there is some cool stuffs out there like scikit-learn and tensorflow, but again, my goal is to gain thourough intuition about the mechanism of each Machine Learning models, so I want to re-build some of the supervised learning models, and later on, unsupervised learning models
